Microcontroller LIDAR Project. A grade of 100% was achieved.
LIDAR Spatial Mapping Using Time-of-Flight
•Designed an embedded system to map areas in 3D
•Programmed I2C communication in C via Keil to obtain and transmit real-time distance values from a ToF sensor
•Automated the data transmission process with Python 
•Visualization of the 3D space from coordinates was made
